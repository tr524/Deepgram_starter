Getting Started
An introduction to getting transcription data from pre-recorded audio files.

Pre-recorded
This guide will walk you through how to transcribe pre-recorded audio with the Deepgram API. We provide two scenarios to try: transcribe a remote file and transcribe a local file.

üìò
Before you start, you'll need to follow the steps in the Make Your First API Request guide to obtain a Deepgram API key, and configure your environment if you are choosing to use a Deepgram SDK.

API Playground
First, quickly explore Deepgram Speech to Text in our API Playground.

üõù
Try this feature out in our API Playground!

CURL
Next, try it with CURL. Add your own API key where it says YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY and then run the following examples in a terminal or your favorite API client.

If you run the "Local file CURL Example," be sure to change @youraudio.wav to the path/filename of an audio file on your computer. (Read more about supported audio formats here).

Remote File CURL Example
Local File CURL Example

curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"url":"https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav"}' \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-2&smart_format=true'
‚ÑπÔ∏è
The above example includes the parameter model=nova-2, which tells the API to use Deepgram's most powerful and affordable model. Removing this parameter will result in the API using the default model, which is currently model=base.

It also includes Deepgram's Smart Formatting feature, smart_format=true. This will format currency amounts, phone numbers, email addresses, and more for enhanced transcript readability.

SDKs
To transcribe pre-recorded audio using one of Deepgram's SDKs, follow these steps.

Install the SDK
Open your terminal, navigate to the location on your drive where you want to create your project, and install the Deepgram SDK.

JavaScript
Python
C#
Go

# Install the Deepgram JS SDK
# https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk

npm install @deepgram/sdk
Add Dependencies
JavaScript
Python
C#
Go

# Install dotenv to protect your api key

npm install dotenv
Transcribe a Remote File
This example shows how to analyze a remote audio file (a URL that hosts your audio file) using Deepgram's SDKs. In your terminal, create a new file in your project's location, and populate it with the code.

JavaScript
Python
C#
Go

// index.js (node example)

const { createClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");
require("dotenv").config();

const transcribeUrl = async () => {
  // STEP 1: Create a Deepgram client using the API key
  const deepgram = createClient(process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);

  // STEP 2: Call the transcribeUrl method with the audio payload and options
  const { result, error } = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeUrl(
    {
      url: "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav",
    },
    // STEP 3: Configure Deepgram options for audio analysis
    {
      model: "nova-2",
      smart_format: true,
    }
  );

  if (error) throw error;
  // STEP 4: Print the results
  if (!error) console.dir(result, { depth: null });
};

transcribeUrl();
Transcribe a Local File
This example shows how to analyze a local audio file (an audio file on your computer) using Deepgram's SDKs. In your terminal, create a new file in your project's location, and populate it with the code. (Be sure to replace the audio filename with a path/filename of an audio file on your computer.)

JavaScript
Python
C#
Go

# main.py (python example)

import os

from deepgram import (
    DeepgramClient,
    PrerecordedOptions,
    FileSource,
)

# Path to the audio file
AUDIO_FILE = "spacewalk.mp3"

def main():
    try:
        # STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the API key
        deepgram = DeepgramClient()

        with open(AUDIO_FILE, "rb") as file:
            buffer_data = file.read()

        payload: FileSource = {
            "buffer": buffer_data,
        }

        #STEP 2: Configure Deepgram options for audio analysis
        options = PrerecordedOptions(
            model="nova-2",
            smart_format=True,
        )

        # STEP 3: Call the transcribe_file method with the text payload and options
        response = deepgram.listen.rest.v("1").transcribe_file(payload, options)

        # STEP 4: Print the response
        print(response.to_json(indent=4))

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Non-SDK Code Examples
If you would like to try out making a Deepgram speech-to-text request in a specific language (but not using Deepgram's SDKs), we offer a library of code-samples in this Github repo. However, we recommend first trying out our SDKs.

Results
In order to see the results from Deepgram, you must run the application. Run your application from the terminal. Your transcripts will appear in your shell.

JavaScript
Python
C#
Go

# Run your application using the file you created in the previous step
# Example: node index.js

node YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.js
‚ö†Ô∏è
Deepgram does not store transcripts, so the Deepgram API response is the only opportunity to retrieve the transcript. Make sure to save output or return transcriptions to a callback URL for custom processing.

Analyze the Response
When the file is finished processing (often after only a few seconds), you‚Äôll receive a JSON response:

In this default response, we see:

transcript: the transcript for the audio segment being processed.

confidence: a floating point value between 0 and 1 that indicates overall transcript reliability. Larger values indicate higher confidence.

words: an object containing each word in the transcript, along with its start time and end time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream, and a confidence value.

Because we passed the smart_format: true option to the transcription.prerecorded method, each word object also includes its punctuated_word value, which contains the transformed word after punctuation and capitalization are applied.

The transaction_key in the metadata field can be ignored. The result will always be "transaction_key": "deprecated".

Limits
There are a few limits to be aware of when making a pre-recorded speech-to-text request.

File Size
The maximum file size is limited to 2 GB.
For large video files, extract the audio stream and upload only the audio to Deepgram. This reduces the file size significantly.
Rate Limits
Nova, Base, and Enhanced Models:

Maximum of 100 concurrent requests per project.
Whisper Model:

Paid plan: 15 concurrent requests.
Pay-as-you-go plan: 5 concurrent requests.
Exceeding these limits will result in a 429: Too Many Requests error.

Maximum Processing Time
Fast Transcription Models (Nova, Base, and Enhanced)

These models offer extremely fast transcription.
Maximum processing time: 10 minutes.
Slower Transcription Model (Whisper)

Whisper transcribes more slowly compared to other models.
Maximum processing time: 20 minutes.
Timeout Policy

If a request exceeds the maximum processing time, it will be canceled.
In such cases, a 504: Gateway Timeout error will be returned.
